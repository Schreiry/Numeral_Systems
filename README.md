## Prologue
As a dedicated student of **Computing Hardware**, I was eager to create an all-encompassing study guide on numeral systems. At the same time, I embraced the challenge of learning LaTeX, a powerful tool for creating high-quality documents. Merging these two passions, I developed this repository to serve as both a comprehensive study guide and a demonstration of LaTeX's elegance.

## About Numeral Systems
Numeral systems are methods for representing numbers using a set of symbols based on a specific base. They were created to simplify mathematical operations and to design efficient computational algorithms and digital circuits. Here’s a quick overview:

- **Binary System (Base 2):**  
  Uses only two digits (0 and 1). It forms the foundation of all modern digital computing.
  
- **Octal System (Base 8):**  
  Comprises digits from 0 to 7. It provides a concise way to represent binary data.
  
- **Decimal System (Base 10):**  
  The standard system used in everyday life, employing digits 0 through 9.
  
- **Hexadecimal System (Base 16):**  
  Uses digits 0–9 and letters A–F. This system is favored in programming due to its direct relationship with binary numbers.

Each system was designed with specific applications in mind, reflecting the needs of both human comprehension and machine efficiency.
